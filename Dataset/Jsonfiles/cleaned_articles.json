        "content": "Michael Peloso and Dan McCraveBessette are associate director and director respectively at the Construction Advisory Services practice of JS Held a global consulting firm based in Jericho New York Opinions are the authors own The Federal Highway Administration has issued a final rule to implement the Build America Buy America Act which will impact transportation projects funded by federal dollars While the rule may be adjusted following a regulatory freeze period the Trump administration has expressed that it may strengthen Buy America requirements This final rule issued on Jan 14 and in effect on March 17 rescinds the Manufactured Products General Waiver Rescinding this waiver will require contractors to certify that manufactured products used on federally funded projects meet two main requirements that final assembly of products occur in the US and that manufactured products be comprised of a majority of domestic content by cost Michael Peloso Courtesy of JS Held The new rule is part of the Build America Buy America Act enacted in 2021 as part of the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act and aims to align with federal goals of strengthening domestic supply chains and reducing reliance on foreign materials To comply with the Buy America requirements products must satisfy the following criteria For projects obligated on or after October 1 2025 Final assembly of products must occur in the United States For projects obligated on or after October 1 2026 Products must contain at least 55 domestic content by cost While these changes intend to prioritize domestic manufacturing there may be implications for project cost schedule and compliance Heres what construction professionals need to understand about the rule its requirements and the potential impacts Potential impacts of the rescinded waiver The length of the design and construction lifecycle for projects tends to be longer in duration and typically spans different political environments Because of this the magnitude and timing of these changes can have various impacts specifically if later in the project lifecycle In some cases this will lead to costly disputes from unapproved change orders mediation arbitration or lengthy litigation The rescinding of the Manufactured Products General Waiver will likely have implications to the cost schedule and quality of federally funded projects Cost The change in the requirements could impact project budgets due to increases in both procurement and compliance costs This may lead to lower margins change orders and disputes from subcontractors the ability to bond additional projects and financial statement pressures As contractors and suppliers are compelled to utilize domestic sources for manufactured products the availability of materials at least in the short term is likely to be limited leading to increased demand and rising prices The additional requirements will also result in the need for greater resources to ensure compliance with the Buy America requirements over a broader range of products than has been needed historically Contractors and suppliers should consider the budget implications of these additional resources during the planning stage of the project in order to avoid later cost overruns Schedule The changes to the waiver and new requirements may also impact the entire product procurement cycle including buyout engineering fabrication and delivery Dan McCraveBessette Permission granted by JS Held With the potential for more restrictions on product availability the supply chain will likely entail longerthannormal efforts to identify suitable domestic suppliers in place of foreign firms Additional time must be allotted to vet these companies to ensure compliance with Buy America requirements and technical specifications Contractors should prepare up front in the planning phases with additional risk management planning and contingencies for extended procurement times or supply chain issues compared to existing product sources A costbenefit analysis should be considered when deciding to make a waiver request as processing times and approvals are not guaranteed Some states such as Rhode Island have already updated specifications to include language that any delays caused by the waiver process will be the sole responsibility of the contractor Besides costs contractors and suppliers would be wise to evaluate these additional time considerations associated with these processes during the development of early schedules including prebid and project baselines Quality Lastly in addition to cost and schedule concerns contractors and suppliers must remain vigilant in ensuring product compliance with technical requirements as new vendors and new products enter the marketplace or substandard options become available Contractors will want to increase quality assurance and control efforts to ensure that proper due diligence of products continues to meet the quality standards required by the contract specifications and industry standards As with cost and schedule it would be prudent of contractors and suppliers to evaluate what additions or changes need to be made to their quality management programs to ensure that the products coming from domestic sources comply with contract requirements Adherence to quality is not only a requirement in contracts and industry but failures that occur because of quality issues can lead to reputational or potentially criminal issues Risk mitigation at each project stage It is important to consider what steps contractors and suppliers can take and when to remain in compliance with these requirements Specifically it is worthwhile to consider the prebid stage and the active project stage as well as how to approach change management Prebid stage Contractors and suppliers should begin with a review of their existing supply chains This review should focus on identifying potential challenges in complying with the requirements Based on this evaluation contractors and suppliers should engage as early as possible with the appropriate stakeholders to determine what steps should be taken to remain compliant In support of this process it may be worthwhile to perform an analysis of alternative suppliers Finally contractors and suppliers should ensure that they clearly communicate the changes in procurement requirements through their contracts and prebid conferences Active construction stage Communication between contractors and their suppliers will be key to ensuring compliance during the active construction stage of projects Contractors and suppliers should be diligent in sharing information regarding costs and schedule as work progresses across the engineering procurement and construction phases In support of this communication contractors and suppliers would be wellserved to establish or reinforce existing tracking systems for material and implement onsite inspections to confirm compliance Change management In the event that changes are required to maintain compliance it is essential that a protocol be established to identify evaluate and approve material substitutions It is in the best interest of all stakeholders to be disciplined in maintaining documentation related to all certifications waivers and contract modifications Looking ahead The FHWAs expansion of Buy America requirements reflects a broader commitment by the federal government to strengthening domestic manufacturing and supply chains However it also demands significant adjustments from project stakeholders as they consider the cost time and quality of projects in which they choose to engage The rescinding of the Manufactured Products General Waiver will likely have consequences that contractors and suppliers should begin planning for as early as possible While the rule remains in a regulatory freeze contractors and suppliers would do well to consider the implications on future projects This includes additional focus on early and continual risk management to identify the cost schedule and quality impacts and working with suppliers to understand the constraints on the supply chain This will be critical in understanding and mitigating those impacts Dan McCraveBessette also contributed to this article",

construction industry Click here for past discussions Liz Fong didnt imagine how much technology would play a role in her career when she first enrolled as a sheet metal apprentice 13 years ago The operations integration manager at Seattlebased mechanical contractor MacDonaldMiller Facility Solutions said that she envisioned herself carrying out traditional tasks in the field or shop on HVAC or architectural work She didnt anticipate the experience she gained in the technological aspects of the industry including software and technology management process development and coding For her work harnessing construction technology to drive the industry forward such as helping with her companys transition to paperless sheet metal fabrication Fong was recently named the 2025 Innovator of the Year by the Sheet Metal and Air Conditioning Contractors National Association Liz is a standout member of our community who is both skilled and proactive said Linda Jennings SMACNA executive director of innovation integration and learning She is a recognized authority on multiple technology platforms and a goto expert in the field who excels at developing strategies that minimize disruption and maximize results Here Fong talks with Construction Dive about the work she loves why she was drawn to a construction career and the importance of technology in the industry This interview has been edited for brevity and clarity CONSTRUCTION DIVE What led you to choose construction for your career Liz Fong Permission granted by SMACNA LIZ FONG After initially pursuing the college route and eventually continuing to a graduate program I ultimately decided not to continue down that path However I was still looking for a career that would allow me to build something longterm and fulfilling Additionally as I approached my 30s financial security became more of a priority Thats when a friend introduced me to Oregon Tradeswomen where I was first exposed to the trades and the idea of construction as a career I found the handson nature of the work the diversity of the trades and the potential for growth really appealing Equally attractive was the earnwhileyoulearn structure of apprenticeships and the high floor set by the trade unions which provide not just steady work but also strong benefits and a clear path for longterm advancement The trades and construction seemed like the perfect fit offering both the stability and variety I was looking for Why do you enjoy working in the sheet metal industry specifically The diversity of the trades has always appealed to me When I was first exposed to multiple trades through Oregon Tradeswomen it was the variety within sheet metal that led me to pursue it over the others In the 13 years since it has not disappointed though not always in the ways I expected What I didnt anticipate was transitioning into software and technology management process development or coding My responsibilities began with managing our model authoring software which lets users create BIM models their associated databases and customizations and have since expanded to influence integrations across the entire lifecycle of model data spanning the fabrication shop field operations logistics and even extending to estimating And now I cant imagine doing anything else While Im no longer handson with my tradecraft its a privilege to support my trades family and facilitate their success What are some of the projects youve most enjoyed working on and why A few projects Ive particularly enjoyed working on stand out due to the sense of trust and responsibility they gave me as well as the opportunity to develop new skills As an apprentice one project that stands out is the Via6 Towers in Seattle for which I touched just about every single louver plenum assembly across two 24story buildings While far from glamorous the fabrication process was specific and differed from the traditional duct fabrication I had done up until that point which made it a special experience for me as a firstyear apprentice Another memorable project was the Yakama Casino in Toppenish Washington which was my first detailing project It marked a pivotal moment in my career as a springboard into using technology in my work This transition allowed me to build on my trade experience while diving into the broader scope of fabrication processes and technical workflows not just for sheet metal but also for plumbing and piping trades as well On the workflow development side I really enjoyed contributing to our transition to paperless sheet metal fabrication This project involved gathering and transforming data for various purposes from inventory management and material ordering to facilitating specific shop station activities It was a great way for me to apply my experience with Autodesk Fabrication content VDC and shop fabrication workflows while also exploring new areas like SQL and PowerApps The project was both a challenge and a rewarding opportunity to expand my skill set while improving our teams overall efficiency What benefits are there to working in construction One of the most rewarding aspects of working in construction is the tangible nature of the final product whether your primary tool is a hammer or a computer Its incredibly satisfying to see the direct impact of your efforts on a project knowing youve contributed to building something meaningful The work offers variety requiring a diverse set of roles and skills and because the industry is always evolving theres always something new to learn This keeps things interesting and helps avoid the monotony found in other fields Additionally construction offers stability As a union member I enjoy job security competitive wages strong benefits and a clear path for longterm advancement The learn while you earn structure of apprenticeships is also a huge advantage with a low barrier to entry that makes the trades accessible to people of all ages and backgrounds What advice would you give to young women considering construction as a career For anyone considering a career in construction my advice would be to embrace the opportunities the industry offers even if it feels intimidating at first Dont let stereotypes or outdated perceptions hold you back from pursuing the trades or limit your understanding of construction to manual labor With the advancement of technology and the increasing emphasis on safety theres a place for everyone in every aspect of construction from the field to the office and everything in between Know that your unique perspective is valuable and vital to the success of any industry Diversity brings new ideas and approaches which are critical to innovation and creative problemsolving The construction industry offers the chance to build a career that is not only personally fulfilling but also provides longterm financial security and growth",

Sidekicks The Safety Sidekick Skanskas newest internal offering helps employees access Skanska data on safety and jobsite conditions It helps employees plan toolbox talks and huddles and gives them a resource at their disposal Here Nelson talks with Construction Dive about the Safety Sidekicks origins how it fits into the companys current AI suite and the advice she has for builders looking to incorporate AI into their own workflows Editors Note This interview has been edited for brevity and clarity CONSTRUCTION DIVE How did the idea of the Skanska Safety Sidekick come about ANITA NELSON We saw a need to make these insights more immediate and more actionable on jobsites This data is not often leveraged in real time Sidekick allows us to look at that data in a specific way Using generative AI trained on Skanskaspecific safety data and jobsite conditions it allows us to deliver custom toolbox talks safety observations and proactive suggestions to workers Anita Nelson Permission granted by Skanska USA On a daytoday basis that means workers can ask the AI tool safety related questions via mobile or desktop and get instant support for planning a morning huddle or addressing a new hazard Beyond text if youve got a picture of site conditions that day you can ask questions related to that image The tool is also embedded into our workflow so its not an added step in the day its very user friendly Safety Sidekick is one of a suite of AI offerings that Skanska has How does it fit into that Our data solutions team in collaboration with information technology theyve developed four secure internal AI tools Theres Skanska Sidekick which is based on OpenAIs GPT4o model Thats a general use chat bot that protects user business data so you can ask it anything within our organization or outside our organization Then we have three expert sidekicks Ones called My Skanska Sidekick and that searches for key documents on our internal intranet site So if youre looking for a risk management protocol or our sustainability report or whos the leader of something you can ask it for that Then we have an Operational Risk Sidekick which is one of my other favorites for our folks in the field Its comprised of thousands of case studies and experiences across different project types and building systems It gives you strategies and mitigation plans for existing risks on jobs Safety Sidekick is the newest member of our suite What hurdles did you have to clear to make this AI available to your team Because we had developed others it was really about making sure that we got the documents in place Our early users constantly give us feedback in real time on whats working and whats not We dont launch things you know to all 3000plus building employees right away We take time to pilot see whats working see whats not I dont think we ran into any hurdles on this particular launch because the technology is there I dont want to say its as easy as plugandplay because my data scientists would tell me its more complex than that But really a lot of our challenges are going to be about the quality of the data and whether our data warehouse has the right information What have been the benefits Our early users are definitely reporting time saved when preparing safety briefings and improved jobsite engagement I think that is critical When youre preparing for a morning huddle you might be preparing for that the night before You might be planning that day before on your commute This makes it really easy for people Theyre not getting to the trailer and figuring it out Theyre not staying late the night before to figure it out What advice would you give a smaller contractor who wants to implement this kind of tech Start with the data that you know You start with the low hanging fruit When youre looking at generative AI or language models if you have documents and you want to have them scanned and create a chat bot on top of it thats all well and good But if theres not an infrastructure that you invest in to do that thats where youre going to run into trouble Additionally we were able to build this ourselves Dont think you have to build it yourself We have a big enough organization and a lot of our own systems and protocols that require that But there are products off the shelf I wouldnt be able to list them or the sites but I know they exist and so you can start small by testing one thing I think for us we started with operational risk We started with the general Skanska Sidekick to play around with these things to answer immediate challenges Safety was not the first tool While it was at the top of the list we wanted to make sure that we have this right because you dont want to have the wrong safety information You want to walk before you run",

        "content": "Listen to the article 7 min This audio is autogenerated Please let us know if you have feedback This feature is a part of The Dotted Line series which takes an indepth look at the complex legal landscape of the construction industry To view the entire series click here Nearly every prime contractor has a story about a nightmare sub Whether its shoddy work or simply failing to show up to the jobsite suboptimal partners in todays labor and skills market are an increasingly common reality Trent Cotney Courtesy of Adams and Reese LLP Trent Cotney a partner and head of the construction practice at Tampa Floridabased Adams and Reese said since the COVID19 pandemic there has been exponential growth in the use of subcontractors on jobsites A problem subcontractor would be any person or entity who consistently causes issues that would negatively impact a construction project he said Common problems include work delays miscommunication or noncommunication lack of proper equipment or expertise or manpower a failure to comply with safety regulations or payment issues and delays all of which affect project continuity To safeguard their interests and ensure project success attorneys say contractors must understand effective strategies and contractual protections to deal with problem subs If a prime is smart they will do their homework in advance Cotney said Know what youre getting into and dont do work with subs that arent reliable or get into trouble Its worth paying more to have a professional subcontractor work with you Dealing with problem subs Jeffrey Paul Lutz a construction attorney in the Atlanta office of CM Law noted the first line of defense for avoiding problem subs is to conduct a thorough investigation into their past work history and to make thoughtful decisions during the hiring process Jeffrey Paul Lutz Courtesy of CM Law The lowest bidder means little if hiring them will cost you more in the long run through the change order process corrective work dispute resolution andor the engagement of counsel he said I advise all of my contractor clients to conduct detailed background checks review past performance and verify references to ensure the subcontractor has a solid track record The second line of defense would be to draft a clear and comprehensive subcontract that outlines the scope of work deadlines quality standards and penalties for noncompliance A wellcrafted subcontract defines expectations clearly to ensure accountability quality and timely delivery Lutz said During the project it is important to implement a system for ongoing oversight and quality control to ensure work meets the required standards and address issues promptly to prevent them from escalating This can be accomplished through effective communication and maintaining open and transparent communication with subcontractors to foster collaboration and quickly resolve any issues Lutz said While onsite regular communication is critical it is equally important to document your written directives in writing GCs face untold risks when working with problem subs most often in the context of secondrate work and financial losses After all GCs are responsible for the work of their subs so they take on potentially substantial risk if their subs perform poorly Problem subs who fail to meet project specifications timelines or quality standards will likely cause delays to the project cost impacts potential reputational damage and potential legal disputes which last wellbeyond the projects duration Lutz said Effective risk management strategies such as thorough vetting clear contracts and ongoing oversight can help mitigate these risks Provisions in contracts Mitigating disputes with problem subs boils down to welldrafted contracts and good lines of communication lawyers say Chad Caplan a partner at Albany New Yorkbased law firm Hinckley Allen noted regardless of ones due diligence during the selection process trouble can still arise Thats why the way subcontracts are set up and the provisions they contain can make or break a primes leverage even before a dispute arises For example subcontracts should explicitly state that time is of the essence emphasizing the importance of adhering to deadlines and should allow for reasonable amendments to project schedules and milestones to accommodate unforeseen circumstances The agreement must specify that certain conditions such as claim submissions are strict preconditions outlining precise timelines procedures and necessary documentation for claims including backup materials Caplan said Additionally limiting liability for consequential damages and clarifying that liquidated damages are not penalties but proportionate to potential losses are crucial Those clauses should allow liquidated damages to to be assessed relative to the fault of the subcontractor Caplan said Consequences and insurance Even then problems can arise Thomas Cotton a partner with Schenck Price Smith King in Florham Park New Jersey warned that a prime contractor should understand there are no magic words that will ensure 100 protection from problem subs Still certain provisions can help Thomas Cotton Courtesy of Schenck Price Smith King For one he points to flowdown clauses which bind a subcontractor to the terms of the prime contract The purpose is to guard against any gaps between what the general contractor and subs agree to do When a gap appears consequences should be spelled out clearly including booting the sub from the job There should also be strong and express remedies for nonperformance he said The agreement should among other things expressly empower the general contractor to terminate the subcontractor with the maximum discretion to the general contractor and further allow the general contractor to hire a replacement at the subcontractors expense Additionally not only should the subcontractor be required to maintain insurance levels that are adequate visàvis any loss exposures the subcontractor should also be required to add the general contractor and others as additional insureds to their policies Its imperative that subcontractors maintain specific levels of insurance coverage to protect against potential liabilities Lutz said Also indemnification clauses protect the GC from claims arising from the subcontractors actions Payment and performance bonds can also be required as another assurance that a subcontractors failures will not lead to an overall project failure",

contractor Graycor Opinions are the authors own Ill go out on a limb with what may be an unpopular sentiment at the moment President Donald Trumps economic policies and tariffs may very well help expedite the return of manufacturing to the US Brian Gallagher Courtesy of Graycor However they wont achieve that outcome in a vacuum While some early investments are underway widespread movement will likely unfold gradually over time and only when a more comprehensive policy approach takes shape Initial investments across industries such as automotive steel semiconductors and life sciences do point to a possible reevaluation of the United States as a location for production not just consumption Still beneath the surface of these announcements lies a more nuanced reality Reshoring manufacturing involves complex longterm decisions that require significant planning capital and coordination After all reshoring isnt a onesizefitsall solution its viability depends heavily on the industry cost structure and supply chain complexity For some sectors especially those with lowmargin highvolume products maintaining global production may remain the most practical and efficient option The reason why is because constructing a new large manufacturing facility is a complex and multifaceted process that even under optimal conditions spans 24 to 36 months This timeline encompasses site selection design permitting and actual construction Beyond those hurdles reshoring forces companies to rethink and restructure their entire business Bringing production back to the US requires careful consideration of sourcing logistics and distribution strategies to ensure longterm efficiency and resilience For many companies despite these challenges the ability to manufacture closer to demand while tapping into a highly developed market still may be a compelling factor in longterm strategic planning A longterm investment However when companies make decisions to invest capital they want a level of certainty and predictability not volatility uncertainty complexity and ambiguity Beyond the whipsaw rollout of tariffs thus far the longevity of the current administrations policy is still uncertain regardless of what transpires after an initial 90day waiting period Thats because the current administrations policies can still be modified or repealed by the next president For businesses looking to reshore facilities thats a nonstarter Strategic decisions like this require stability longterm visibility and confidence in both the economic and political landscape Given this outlook most manufacturers who play the long game with their capital even with the allure of getting access to the worlds richest market may be hesitant to commit to significant multiyear investments in this environment A big ask While the intent behind tariffs is to promote domestic manufacturing the practical challenges and economic realities suggest that a significant resurgence in US manufacturing will be challenging Rather than diving in immediately companies will plan with intentionality and clarity evaluating how reshoring fits within their broader operational strategies Its a complex decision that involves balancing risk cost and opportunity In other words reshoring manufacturing to the United States is not a sprint that unfolds over the first 100 days of any given administration Its a marathon that requires longterm commitment strategic foresight and consistent support from both the public and private sectors The Trump administrations policies serve as a positive catalyst for reshoring and renewed manufacturing investment but its important to recognize that the initial wave of activity will likely occur on a more modest scale While tariffs and political rhetoric may spark movement they alone are not enough for a sustained manufacturing revival A broader approach Whats needed is a more comprehensive industrial strategy pairing targeted tariffs with strong economic incentives such as competitive corporate tax rates and streamlined regulatory and permitting processes At the same time tackling key enablers like modernizing supply chains investing in workforce development and adopting advanced manufacturing technologies will position the US as a global leader in nextgeneration production With the right policy mix and industry alignment America is wellequipped to lead a true manufacturing renaissance The path forward is complex but with deliberate action and a unified vision the US has the opportunity to reclaim its leadership in global manufacturing not just through tariffs but through a holistic approach and focused execution To successfully accelerate reshoring we must go beyond tariffs To attract continued foreign direct investment and drive sustained growth in US manufacturing a more encompassing strategy that looks beyond the next political or election cycle is essential Its only through this type of considered deliberate approach that America will achieve its next manufacturing miracle one that will last far longer than the current political cycle",

        "content": "Listen to the article 6 min This audio is autogenerated Please let us know if you have feedback Dive Brief The Inflation Reduction Act which passed in 2022 without any Republican support and is anticipated to cost taxpayers between 780 billion and 2 trillion over its first ten years is likely to be targeted for cuts as the Republicancontrolled Congress aims to cut spending by 2 trillion in order to cut taxes by 45 trillion However certain provisions of the IRA have won support with Republican lawmakers setting up likely disagreements over cuts in the budget reconciliation process That process is already expected to be very contentious said Harry Godfrey who leads Advanced Energy Uniteds federal investment and manufacturing working group House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Jason Smith and the Ways and Means Republicans will need revenue and will be seeking it and have been saying all along that the IRA is an area theyre going to look at said Ryan Abraham a principal with Ernst Youngs Washington Council advisory practice But obviously there are some concerns among some members Dive Insight Abraham noted the May 1 letter sent by 26 House Republicans to Chairman Smith advocating for the preservation of the IRAs 45U 45Y and 48E tax credits The letter advocates on behalf of nuclear power specifically urging Smith to maintain federal investment in the existing nuclear energy fleet while accelerating deployment of the next generation of nuclear power technologies The 45U credit is the IRAs zeroemission nuclear power production credit while 48E and 45Y are technologyneutral credits which were targeted in legislation introduced in April by Rep Julie Fedorchak RND Theres a lot of concern that some of the bonus items that have been created in the IRA like direct pay and transferability which were also in that Fedorchak bill could also get targeted Abraham said However he said Chairman Smith is aware that if he goes too far potentially that those 26 members are going to vote against the bill Electric vehicleassociated IRA credits remain an anticipated target Abraham said but were not going to know until we see the bill Abraham said Smith is likely thinking about other policies that those members might also either want to protect or get in the bill as another way to potentially appease those members such as offering a better or more generous fix on the individual state and local tax deduction or SALT cap So I dont think we can look at just the IRA completely on its own he said But those members have mentioned that the IRA is very important to them the jobs economic investment unleashing American energy all of that In March 21 Republicans sent Smith a letter asking that changes to the IRA be made in a targeted and pragmatic fashion and this followed an August letter from 18 Republican lawmakers to Speaker Mike Johnson RLa making a similar request Abraham said that the increasing public support from Republicans for certain IRA provisions is absolutely setting the party up for a fight as its budget bill advances Trumps role Godfrey said that President Trumps budget proposal which called for steep cuts to the Department of Energy and Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act was more ideological and less strategic than wed hope adding that he hopes the budget process plays out in the way it often does the President proposes and Congress disposes The presidents budget came in later than it normally would Godfrey noted and he anticipates that budget negotiations will go longer than previously forecast Godfrey said Trumps broad proposed cuts to IIJA were disappointing as it was a bipartisan package aimed at building up American infrastructure with several spending priorities like energy transportation which Democrats and Republicans have historically had broad agreement upon If were being really strategic both from a political perspective hey a bunch of the stuff has bipartisan support like do we really want to get into a fight with congressional appropriators over stuff that has bipartisan support he said But also if were building for American energy dominance and for manufacturing leadership do we really want to cut that Godfrey noted that Trumps proposed cuts may conflict with the priorities of Republicans in Congress and that he is cautiously optimistic that the budget will change shape as Congress negotiates Weve seen Democrats and Republicans be willing to stand up including Republicans in deep red states and engage with the Trump administration and say hey please dont cut this he said And weve seen the Trump administration acknowledge that in some cases and act upon that Godfrey said he thinks the credits included in the IRA are really key to building the US energy dominance that Trump has made a priority and pulling them back would only serve to undermine that mission as well as undercutting economic development particularly in Republican districts The jobs the billions in investments thats happening in red districts he said adding that he thinks the letters from Republican lawmakers to members of leadership advocating for aspects of the IRA are an acknowledgment on the part of members of that economic dynamic",

and a renewed commitment to training and compliance But it is also a chance to explore new approaches and techniques that can help continue to improve jobsite safety Construction Dive asked several environmental health and safety leaders working for major players in the industry for the areas firms could pay more attention to in order to improve safety Their responses run the gamut from physical and mental health to executing on a wellthoughtout plan The following responses have been edited for brevity and clarity Jeff Palombo Robins Morton vice president of safety A couple of areas that contractors and safety experts should pay more attention to in order to continue improving jobsite safety are the integration of human performance methodologies and datadriven decisionmaking Jeff Palombo Permission granted by Robins Morton First by focusing on identifying and eliminating error precursors and latent organizational weaknesses that contribute to human error contractors can better understand the operating system factors that drive human behavior Contractors use this understanding to reduce the likelihood and severity of workplace incidents with the integration of consequencecontrol strategies building resilience to failure Second by collecting and analyzing observational data contractors can create a more accurate picture of errorlikely conditions and how to improve safety on their projects Hannah Waters Jacobs vice president of global health safety and environment In addition to focusing on highrisk activities and onsite safety our industry could pay more attention to mental health and wellbeing While physical safety is paramount its important to address the psychological aspects of worker health Providing support resources promoting open communication and fostering a supportive work environment can help mitigate stress improve overall job satisfaction and ultimately influence safe and secure decisionmaking In collaboration with global mental health professionals Jacobs developed One Million Lives a free mental health checkin tool and resources enabling users to check their mental health and access proactive strategies for personal mental health development Todd Friis Clayco senior vice president of risk management Planning It sounds basic but planning is where safety starts and often where it fails You obviously need to be in the field auditing and observing but we see a lot of value in laying out good plans before the work even starts Too many incidents are the result of rushed schedules or incomplete pretask planning Todd Friis Permission granted by Clayco We set up sitespecific safety plans for the project that take into account the requirements of our program plus state and client requirements before the project even starts Similarly before any of our subcontractors start on the job they have to create their own sitespecific safety plan for how their scope of work will be done safely as well We hold daily coordination meetings and weekly lookahead meetings We also have each crew complete a daily pretask safety analysis an exercise that incorporates all other considerations as they map out how to safely approach their specific tasks for the day We find time and time again that the projects and contractors that place a lot of emphasis on making solid plans consistently result in having some of the highest safety performance Shaun Carvalho Permission granted by Shawmut Shaun Carvalho Shawmut Design and Construction chief safety officer Ensuring trade partners have a good safe experience that is built on respect both physical and psychological is vital to the industrys future Tradespeople work on multiple sites and for multiple contractors yearly As construction managers we must align on providing the best physical and mental health resources and support creating inclusive environments where everyone can perform their best Steve Spaulding Turner Construction chief environmental health and safety officer First we need to move beyond the idea that safety is solely the responsibility of the safety expert Safety belongs to everyone Steve Spaulding Permission granted by Turner Every person on the jobsite must feel empowered to speak up to protect themselves and one another Thats what All In Together this weeks theme means to me a culture of shared responsibility and collective care Proactive planning for highrisk activities must be a top priority in every conversation because thats where the greatest potential for serious injury or fatality lies Weve made real progress in raising the standards of care and building environments where people feel safe and supported Equally important is continuing to talk openly about mental wellbeing The growing attention to psychological safety is a positive shift and we will keep expanding awareness resources and support Ultimately the goal is to strengthen a culture where the worker is more important than the work here safety isnt a checklist but a mindset and a mission Its about daily acts of care that reflect who we are and what we value Tricia Thibodeaux Permission granted by Fluor Tricia Thibodeaux Fluor vice president health safety and environmental Contractors and safety experts should focus on cultivating a strong safety culture through demonstrated care and management engagement When workers feel genuinely valued they are more likely to adopt safe practices report hazards collaborate in safety planning and become safety leaders themselves Culture can be elevated through regular safety meetings open communication channels and visible leadership involvement in safety initiatives By focusing on these areas companies can improve jobsite safety and create a safer more productive working environment for all employees Lonnie Schock DPR environmental health and safety and leadership team member We believe that ongoing improvements require a focus beyond the typical physical safety environment to include holisticwholehealth approaches including the expansion of the industrys focus on mental health Recent studies show that construction workers are at a heightened risk of mental health issues with a suicide rate that is 35 times higher than the national average Lonnie Schock Permission granted by DPR Having a better understanding of personal wellness nutrition and mental health will help engage teams and lead to safer projects and a safer industry overall We are working together with our industry partners and peers to raise more awareness on these issues including recognizing when help is needed removing the stigma around having these types of important conversations and working left of the line to ensure people are healthy in all ways",

administration would work with undocumented immigrants who selfdeport from the country and return them to the US if theyre good if we want them back in has not assuaged employers staffing concerns amid immigration crackdowns employerside attorneys told HR Dive Trump might need to work with Congress to pass legislation in order to create such a program said Bruce Buchanan senior counsel at Littler Mendelson Even if that were possible he noted it is not clear how undocumented workers who are currently weighing the option of whether to leave the country would react to such a program The concern always with this president is he says things but is there any action behind it Is someone drafting legislation that will put this in place Or is he just using it as an incentive for people to leave Buchanan said As they say the devils in the details and we didnt get a whole lot of details Trumps remarks signaled a potential addendum to an immigration enforcement agenda that is set to ramp up featuring more frequent audits of paper and electronic Form I9s by US Immigration and Customs Enforcement as well as increased worksite visits The president has said that these moves are essential to enforcing immigration laws But the pattern of enforcement operations may chill employers talent operations Mary Pivec attorney at Pivec Associates PLLC told HR Dive that the Trump administrations targeting of foreign scientists engineers and students teaching and studying in US universities and laboratories would discourage key talent from migrating to the US If the US makes it impossible for people to live and work here they will go elsewhere Pivec said Why stay here and be persecuted Why have your children be subject to searches and seizures or have your phone seized at an airport to see whether youre saying anything negative about this administration Its going to be a drain on the talented people that we want here In an email following up on Trumps April 15 remarks Pivec told HR Dive that Trumps statement did not change the ontheground talent issues employers face Ad hoc fixes floated by the President dont begin to address the labor shortages that exist and can only get worse as Trumps mass deportation campaign continues to play out she wrote US Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers prepare for morning raids to arrest undocumented immigrants on April 11 2018 in New York NY Recent enforcement actions have caused employers to scrutinize their compliance processes attorneys told HR Dive John Moore via Getty Images Employers now wary in their hiring processes Trumps enforcement efforts already presented employers with a need to scrutinize their Form I9 compliance including electronic Form I9 programs provided by vendors But the knockon effect of the administrations enforcement posture is that it has made employers hesitant to hire foreign workers Chris Thomas partner at Holland Hart said in an interview Employers cant discriminate against employees who are foreignborn Thomas said but they are at least a little more wary of their onboarding processes to ensure they properly screen the documentation of the I9 process Despite the administrations aggressive enforcement plans the Republican Partys 2024 campaign platform called for the largest deportation program in American history permit applications for work authorization remained elevated entering 2025 suggesting that immigrant workers continued to contribute to labor supply growth according to a Brookings Institution analysis of USCIS data Even so all of this chaos is rattling both employers and employees Chris Thomas Partner Holland Hart That trend could be constrained in part by the Trump administrations partial termination of Temporary Protected Status designations for Haitians and Venezuelans These changes caused panic among employers Thomas said though a federal judge enjoined in March the administrations action with respect to Venezuela designees Other programs have been targeted as well such as the categorical parole programs for Cubans Haitians Nicaraguans and Venezuelans and their immediate family members The US Department of Homeland Security terminated these programs created during the Biden administration in March A federal judge stayed parole termination notices sent to program participants in April but the agency has nonetheless said no new parole requests will be processed Trumps targeting of international students is multifaceted Thomas noted that the administration sought to revoke F1 visas with Optional Practical Training a category that allows students to seek temporary employment directly related to their areas of study for up to 12 months But this specific action has been slowed by federal courts Thomas said in a followup email meaning that student and OPT workers may continue to remain in the county work where authorized and even apply for programs like the H1B visa category in the long term DHS also reportedly began to reinstate the records of some international students whose records the agency terminated according to Bloomberg Law Even so all of this chaos is rattling both employers and employees Thomas said in the email Many employees in these categories have simply given up and returned abroad Employers are also dealing with the uncertainty of a workforce even if those employees have received temporary reprieves that may not be able to continue in their current positions Now applying Aunts uncles children While the battle over immigrants legal status advances employers are advised to begin the process of finding employees who are authorized to work Buchanan said But the reaction he has heard from many clients usually is I cant find any help The search especially for smaller employers is so extensive that it has caused some to turn to family members for help One of Buchanans clients hired his daughter a high school student and others have enlisted aunts uncles and cousins even if only on a temporary basis Seeing the potential talent effects of immigration states may decide to act In Florida Republican lawmakers introduced a bill SB 918 that would remove state work restrictions for minors ages 16 and 17 as a response to the loss of immigrant workers Among other provisions the bill would eliminate restrictions prohibiting 16 and 17yearolds from working more than 8 hours a day on school nights and more than 30 hours during school weeks Im not sure thats the longterm solution for all states but at least its been proposed Buchanan said",

standdowns conducting toolbox talks and ramping up training as a means of highlighting best practices and ensuring each worker on the jobsite gets home safely If you ask the environmental health and safety chiefs working for major players in construction theyll tell you safety is not a competition Sharing practices and collaborating on events like Safety Week is part of how the industry improves the overall wellbeing of the workforce Here leaders share their best practices with Construction Dive for making a difference in worker safety and health Read on to see the programs theyre proudest of The following responses have been edited for brevity and clarity Dave Hulverson Permission granted by Granite Construction Dave Hulverson Granite Construction senior vice president of safety health environment and quality The most significant safety practice we have enacted in the past several years is our STCKY initiative STCKY stands for Stuff that can kill you and is a training enhancement that teaches our workers about the riskiest highenergy hazards on construction sites and how to recognize and mitigate those hazards This initiative has been a gamechanger in improving worker safety and health In addition we recently implemented the Granite Guard hand safety initiative to standardize our hand and power tools across the company This has helped reduce the more common though less severe injuries so we can spend more time focused on eliminating STCKY Tricia Thibodeaux Fluor vice president of health safety and environmental Certain construction operations exhibit a disproportionately high number of precursors for fatalities or serious injuries After evaluating industry data and our own incident history Fluor identified nine operations conducted widely across the company that present the greatest risk of a fatality or serious injury Tricia Thibodeaux Permission granted by Fluor Subject matter experts from across the organization collaborated to enhance work practices training and risk assessments for what we call the Life Critical operations Fluor developed the Safer Choices Together program to educate workers about their personal risk tolerance and its impact on decisionmaking This initiative underscores the importance of making safer choices and recognizing potential hazards before they become issues Given the multitude of decisions made daily each with the potential for error effective decisionmaking is crucial to maintaining our Safer Together culture Individuals must choose to work safely and their safe choices are facilitated by both personal and management engagement Safer Choices Together emphasizes individual learning selfawareness personal investment and growth and input from the work front empowering construction professionals to make informed and safe decisions Lonnie Schock Permission granted by DPR Lonnie Schock DPR environmental health and safety and leadership team member Like others in the construction industry we have come to recognize that the things that cause highfrequency injuries like hand and soft tissue injuries are not the same things that cause severe highimpact incidents With that context DPR has expanded our safety focus to be more allencompassing and to equip our teams with the right tools and resources to better anticipate risks so they can be effectively managed and thus keep people safe As part of this we have started exploring the use of new emerging technologies like machine learning and AI to analyze data and predict potential jobsite hazards so that we can more effectively and proactively act before something goes wrong Todd Friis Clayco senior vice president of risk management We rely a lot on our data to inform the path we take with our safety program For example we see that a lot of injuries happen earlier in the day so we have placed an emphasis on The Golden Hour Its that time first thing in the morning where our field supervisors spend a lot more time out of the office and in the field Todd Friis Permission granted by Clayco Over the years we have seen more and more workers who are brand new to the construction workforce that do not have a lot of understanding of construction safety Looking forward we are trying to help boost this knowledge among our subcontractors by requiring all workers to have at least an OSHA 10 construction certification when they work on our jobsites While this requirement technically doesnt go into effect until July 1 of this year we are already working with our trade partners to help their workers complete this training now It is our feeling that making this a part of our process will help increase awareness and knowledge of safety not just on Clayco jobsites but as they move out to work for other contractors as well helping to improve safety in some way across the industry Bryan Kingsbury Permission granted by Consigli Bryan Kingsbury Consigli Construction corporate safety director Beyond making basic upgrades or enhancements to PPE or equipment such as requiring helmets with chin strap retention weve also identified opportunities where we can leverage our inhouse Virtual Design Construction team to create safer more sustainable jobsites As technology and AI continues to develop weve been intentional about staying innovative in our approach to safety so that we can stay ahead of the curve and make sure our teams are equipped with stateoftheart resources Using drones flown by our VDC team we can conduct virtual safety walks for highreach and higherrisk areas like roofs and site perimeters which allows us to inspect and improve areas that arent easily accessible Were also using a new AI tool to analyze images taken of our jobsites identify safety hazards and make corrective recommendations in an efficient and effective way With AI and cuttingedge VDC solutions issues with site access PPE material storage and more can all be quickly identified and resolved by Consigli teams Jeff Palombo Permission granted by Robins Morton Jeff Palombo Robins Morton vice president of safety operations Our approach to safety management is grounded in our human performance operating philosophy which acknowledges the complexity of our operating system and its influence on behavior including human error We understand that errors expose system weaknesses not personal failings and blame does not improve performance fixing the process does By emphasizing that workers are not the problem and are instead part of the solution a projects leadership culture safety system design and defenses can truly thrive and succeed To support this approach we have developed tools defenses and consequence control strategies that provide our workforce with the capability and flexibility to safely perform work in an everevolving environment Those include Task planning meetings Posttask reviews Performance coaching Granting team members stopwork authority Team forums",

Pleasantonbased California Engineering Contractors has played it safe at the 131 million American River Bridge project in Sacramento California As the job has progressed over the last three years workers have taken a 202020 approach pausing their work every 20 minutes to perform a 20second scan of the area 20 feet around them That has resulted in just one recordable injury a broken right ring finger over more than 100000 hours worked In light of Safety Week the team is holding an event today at the project where in addition to 3D BIM models and dewatered coffer dams crews have used a STCKY Stuff That Can Kill You hazard recognition program to help achieve the low injury rate The job for Caltrans started in 2022 with completion slated for next spring Here Watsonville Californiabased Granites Project Executive Bob Mihal talks to Construction Dive about how the job came about a permitting process that went unusually fast and steps that eliminated 85 million from the overall project cost Editors note This interview has been edited for brevity and clarity CONSTRUCTION DIVE The American River Bridge which carries the I80 BusinessCapital City Freeway over the American River west of Sacramento was originally built in 1954 What issues were emerging in the structure Bob Mihal Courtesy of Granite Construction BOB MIHAL The original bridge was built as two separate parallel bridges in 1954 with a center widening in 1964 and the bridge decks were showing their age Due to the severity of the transverse and longitudinal deck cracks concrete spalling and high corrosive chloride content in the concrete deck surface the bridge deck needed replacement To accomplish the deck replacement the superstructure was first widened to accommodate traffic during construction What were the biggest challenges on this project The substructure work for the deck widening started in the spring of 2022 and we anticipate overall project completion in the spring of 2026 There were several significant challenges including work in an environmentally sensitive floodplain coordinating with multiple environmental agencies as well as the US Army Corps of Engineers weathering the series of atmospheric rivers and associated flooding over the winter and spring of 2023 and the technical challenge of rehabilitating a bridge in halves that was originally built in thirds Access to the work is a constant challenge with a barge fleet in the river maintaining access roads and work pads through multiple winters and bringing material and workers into the center median between heavy flowing traffic on both sides during the first stage of deck reconstruction I understand the JV couldnt work in the river from June to October Why was that and how did you keep the job moving given those parameters From November through May Chinook salmon and steelhead are actively spawning During those months we were restricted in that we could not actively disturb the river or induce piledriving vibrations Outside of that window from June through October we were permitted to work from barges and within the dewatered cofferdams We worked around the restrictions using careful planning and aggressive scheduling Installing all the sheet pile cofferdams and bridge piling in the first season prior to the river window closing in October was a large undertaking but critical for allowing pier construction to progress through the winter Collaboration with the environmental agencies confirmed that working from barges and within the dewatered cofferdams was not considered inwater work Using barges for access in lieu of a conventional temporary trestle bridge was a significant timesaving measure that allowed us to complete the pile driving prior to the river window closing Prepping the replacement deck pour on the American River Bridge Courtesy of Granite Construction This contract was for a job in California which is notorious for environmental and permitting delays in a river with an active salmon run Yet you were able to get it permitted in just 12 months How did you pull that off This was a big success for the collaborative construction managergeneral contractor process on the project Our environmental permitting experts worked closely with the Caltrans environmental team and collaborated with the various permitting agencies to quickly communicate the project work plans and address any concerns prior to the formal permit applications This allowed rapid permitting approval and minimized the typical backandforth process Why is the construction managergeneral contractor contract significant and how did it help in making this job a success Unlike traditional project delivery where a design is completed before the owner selects the contractor in a CMGC project the owner brings in the contractor toward the end of the preliminary design phase The contractor and designer then work together under contractual coordination requirements to complete the final design phase In the process of working through the final design they can work together to identify more opportunities for savings and flexibility In the case of the American River Bridge project one with significant complexity and multiple stakeholders collaborative contracting has been crucial for project success Early permitting aggressive scheduling and collaborative problemsolving allowed construction to start two years early and has kept the project on time and on budget even with the significant technical and environmentalflooding challenges In addition the collaborative innovations developed during design and construction planning have reduced the project cost by more than 85 million March 2025 after the bridge deck was poured Courtesy of Granite Construction This project is currently nearing completion but Granite has several other infrastructure projects that are ongoing How has the funding environment changed this year Work on this project is ongoing and we anticipate overall project completion in the spring of 2026 We see many strong opportunities in the market despite macroeconomic uncertainties and the federal infrastructure bill continues to support growth in construction opportunities Any other details youd like to discuss The use of 3D modeling brought innovation Caltrans usually just gives us design drawings We took the design and made a 3D model and used it for survey and highly accurate field layout This reduced requirements for survey and provided other constructability benefits everything fits better Any time you build bridge foundations in the river you impact the river We decided to work off of barges instead of a trestle which would have basically required building a temporary bridge and would have had significant environmental impacts Dredging the river to create space for barges had lower impacts saved time and was preferred by the environmental permitting agencies This had a real benefit in 2023 during the big floods resulting from the atmospheric rivers we experienced a temporary trestle couldve been swept away Instead we were able to rapidly move the barges and equipment to higher ground and avoided both equipment loss and environmental damage The new bridge will provide a multimodal connection between downtown and eastern Sacramento including a Class 1 bike path that connects to existing bike routes",

project safety manager on the jobsite of the 47story Paramount Bay waterfront condominium complex told crews to cancel a scheduled crane jump for that day he said Souza then stepped into a singlefamily home near the base of the tower which had once been a shooting location for the 1998 comedy Theres Something About Mary and was temporarily being used as an office for the jobsite While sitting in the office Souza called it Marys room for a meeting the crews outside began the crane jump Souza said I heard a loud noise And thats kind of one of the last few things I remember Souza told Construction Dive Parts of the crane which was supported by its monorail became dislodged and fell approximately 50 feet striking an outrigger Then the crane was thrown an additional 350 feet and crashed through the roof of the house The wreckage buried Souza and others in debris and rubble Two people in the room with Souza died He and another employee were hospitalized with injuries per OSHAs report on the incident Two others suffered nonhospitalized injuries Manny Souza Permission granted by Manny Souza Souza says he has no memory of the immediate aftermath from when the crane fell but has been told he was yelling orders to coworkers and responders What he didnt realize until much later was that he had to be brought back I had to be revived a few times Souza said I was only made aware of that after the fact by one of the responders that were there He said We were losing you Today Souza is a senior vice president of environmental health and safety at Greensboro North Carolinabased Samet Corp which was not involved with the crane incident He uses his neardeath story to help improve jobsite safety especially around cranes With my eyes Ive seen the worst that can happen if somethings not managed correctly Souza said Incident background Bovis Lend Lease was the construction manager and Souzas employer on the Miami project UKbased Bovis Construction was acquired by Australianbased Lendlease in 1999 which retired the Bovis brand in 2011 The name has been revived however now that Lendlease has sold its UK business to Greenwich Connecticutbased private equity owner Atlas Holdings which will rename the business Bovis Construction per Construction Enquirer Lendlease has since pivoted away from international work to focus on its business in Australia Safety is always our highest priority a Lendlease spokesperson said in a statement shared with Construction Dive At the time of the incident we worked proactively with OSHA and relevant officials to investigate the incident which ultimately led to the citation being withdrawn Indeed though OSHAs investigation into the collapse resulted in an initial fine of 7000 recommended for the contractor the agency later deleted the citation per OSHAs establishment database Local news reports at the time listed Salem Oregonbased Morrow Crane as the crane subcontractor on the project OSHAs establishment search shows no citation for Morrow Crane at the time of the collapse The firm did not respond to Construction Dives requests for comment Souza said his injuries were unusual in that he didnt sustain a single broken bone but the pressure from the debris that had fallen on him caused significant damage to spinal ligaments and muscle mass in his back He recalls being in and out of hospitals and being unable to return to work for six months That is until he couldnt take it anymore Then I was going insane at the house and I kind of begged for them to take me back Souza said He returned to work at Lendlease through 2020 Sharing his story Souza has become an advocate for improving jobsite safety especially around cranes and hoists Hes spoken to financial advisors and insurance groups to share the liability and risk involved with crane work This year he joined the Associated Builders and Contractors National Health and Safety Committee As Souza tells his harrowing tale his voice is measured When he shares the detail that he was in the house from Theres Something About Mary he does so to bring levity to the narrative despite the undeniable tragedy Souza doesnt hide emotion but he leads with facts almost as though hes presenting a report Thats intentional One thing I had to learn early on if I didnt control the emotional aspects of this I would not be as effective as I am Souza told Construction Dive We can talk for hours here Youre never going to understand the pain that I endure the emotional challenges that we had But that would not bring a lot of credibility if I brought just emotion to the table right Whats changed Thankfully much around crane safety has improved since 2008 Souza says Later that year OSHA proposed a new standard around crane and derrick safety approving the final rule in 2010 A tattoo on Manny Souzas arm which he says he got to remind him about the day of the crane collapse Permission granted by Manny Souza The revision addressed advances in designs of cranes and related hazards the qualifications of employees to operate them the assessment of hazards within the jobsite and required training for workers to recognize hazards But Souza and other safety leaders will tell you that although OSHA sets the baseline expectations for a safe workplace theres much more to safety than compliance Regulatory agencies play a vital role in establishing safety requirements supporting implementation and ensuring accountability to standards across the industry Souza said My focus however is on how we can all proactively enhance safety beyond minimum requirements particularly for highrisk operations like crane work Leaders in both public and private sectors have a responsibility to set rigorous expectations for planning oversight and execution of highrisk construction activities Souza said hes impressed with the privatesector technology implemented to improve crane safety since 2008 which goes above and beyond OSHA rules That includes cameras with live feeds to operators cabins to help avoid blind spots GPS positioning for cranes to be aware of each others location and collision detection and prevention like how some vehicles engage brakes automatically Beyond Safety Week Construction Safety Week held this week from May 5 to May 9 is an opportunity for firms to hold standdowns call attention to hazards on the jobsite and jumpstart new initiatives to improve workplace health The hard part can be extending that focus for the other 51 weeks of the year When the crane eventually was dismantled on that jobsite Souza says lawyers arrived with a court order to take pictures He pushed back because the area below the crane was highly hazardous despite the prospect of legal trouble I can say this with a lot of confidence most professionals would never challenge a court order because of the magnitude of the possible outcome Souza said Eventually he says experts used highpowered lenses to take photographs from a greater and safer distance But that anecdote aligns with an important aspect of Souzas outlook and story When it comes to safety everyone has a different perspective on risk and sometimes they make dangerous decisions Thats part of why he says he has to reduce the emotion in his advocacy for increasing safety and focus on helping people see beyond their own risk analysis regardless of experience You hear this phrase all the time in our industry Ive been doing this for 30 years And Im going to be honest I dont care what it is From sports to performance to anything if youve been doing it the same way you did 30 years ago youre missing an incredible opportunity to be more effective and to be a higher performer Souza said",

businesses and public sector stakeholders across the Washington DC metropolitan region and Puerto Rico Opinions are the authors own The Council on Environmental Qualitys recent rescission of the National Environmental Policy Act Implementing Regulations signals a shift in federal permitting processes for development projects This regulatory change effective as of April 11 impacts environmental reviews nationwide and sets the stage for potentially streamlined development approval timelines While NEPA compliance remains mandatory the framework guiding environmental reviews is changing as federal agencies either revise or develop their own implementing regulations This transformation presents both opportunities and challenges for developers navigating the regulatory landscape For construction professionals and developers these changes could affect everything from project timelines to permitting requirements for largescale developments Alexaida Collet Permission granted by MZLS First its important to clear up a common misunderstanding The removal of NEPA Implementing Regulations does not eliminate NEPA or exempt any projects from its requirements Projects that require federal permits or licenses or that utilize federal funds will still undergo environmental review Whats changing is the framework governing how those reviews are conducted Since 1978 CEQs regulations have served as the master blueprint for environmental reviews across federal agencies With their removal each agency must now develop or revise its own implementing regulations within the next year The goal is to accelerate the federal permitting process and reduce regulatory burdens that have historically extended development approval timelines President Donald Trumps Executive Order 14154 Unleashing American Energy explicitly instructs agencies to expedite and simplify the permitting process In light of this CEQ issued a guidance memorandum on Feb 19 encouraging agencies to use the streamlined 2020 NEPA regulations as a starting point for their revised procedures This approach shows promise particularly when coupled with the 2023 Fiscal Responsibility Acts NEPA amendments which established stricter page limits tighter timelines and a clearer framework for multiagency environmental reviews whereby a lead agency oversees the process If agencies adopt these efficiencyfocused measures the development community could eventually benefit from faster approvals and reduced regulatory burden However immediate benefits seem unlikely CEQ has instructed agencies to maintain their existing NEPA procedures during the transition and not delay ongoing environmental reviews For projects already in the pipeline the process will essentially look the same as it has in recent years More uncertainty ahead The real test will come as agencies begin rolling out their new or revised regulations Will they seize this opportunity to create a more efficient environmental review process Or will the resulting regulations merely replicate the nowrescinded CEQ Implementing Regulations Adding to the complexity is NEPAs status as Americas most litigated federal environmental statute Each agencys new or revised regulations must undergo noticeandcomment rulemaking and may face legal challenges from various stakeholders Agencies must create NEPA compliance frameworks that balance streamlining goals with the legal requirements for thorough environmental reviews For developers with multiagency projects theres a particular concern Without CEQs Implementing Regulations as a blueprint agencies could adopt inconsistent approaches to environmental review creating a fragmented regulatory landscape that developers will need to navigate carefully A project requiring approvals from multiple federal bodies might face different documentation requirements impact analysis scopes or timelines from each agency The administration appears aware of this risk CEQ has established a NEPA Implementation Working Group and monthly agency coordination meetings to promote consistency But achieving true regulatory harmony across all federal agencies presents a formidable challenge A recent example of how contentious this process could become emerged on April 23 when the Department of the Interior issued emergency procedures allowing energy and critical minerals projects to bypass standard NEPA timelines Under the new directive environmental impact statements may be completed in just 28 days and environmental assessments within two weeks a dramatic acceleration that could expose projects to legal challenges if environmental reviews are perceived as insufficient While this emergency move applies specifically to DOImanaged lands it illustrates the broader tensions agencies now face between speed and scrutiny The bottom line In the short term expect continuity while staying alert to transition developments In the longer term anticipate a potentially more streamlined process but one that may vary significantly depending on the federal agencies involved in your project Smart developers will prepare for variations in construction permitting requirements across different federal agencies while staying engaged with regulatory streamlining initiatives Those who closely monitor upcoming agency rulemaking processes and maintain flexibility in their permitting strategies will be best positioned to navigate the changing NEPA landscape successfully",
